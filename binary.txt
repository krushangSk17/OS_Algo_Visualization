we will see binary semaphore now. 

here is a GUI for the binary semaphore.

This is also known as mutex lock. Binary Semaphore strictly provides mutual exclusion. Here, instead of having more than 1 slots available in the critical section, we can only have at most 1 process in the critical section. The semaphore can have only two values, 0 or 1.

here is an algorithm for binary semaphore.all the processes that wants to go inside the critical section has to perform wait operation as a entry section and all the processes that wants to come outside the critical section has to perform the signal opration as the exit section.

press s to start the animation. first p1 will go and change the semaphore value to 0 and will enter into the critical section. 

now p2 will come, as the semaphore value is 0 p2 will go to the block queue.

now p1 will come outside the critical section and change the semaphore value to 1 and at the same time p2 will come outside from the block queue and will enter into the critical section. 

now p2 will come outside the critical section and change the semaphore value to 1. 

binary semaphore ensures the mutual exclusion and bounded waiting for multipple process.
